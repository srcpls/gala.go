play go with gala.go

## about
gala.go is a project I am working on to (hopefully) eventually serve as a sort of playing field for a terrible go playing program called gala.go.  


## features as of now
   * stone grouping
   * grouping of empty space(which should help in determining territory if playing by japanese rules)
   * group capturing
   * simple console representation of the board
  
## currently working on
   * determining the winner of a game by japanese rules
   * ko rule
   * simple gui
