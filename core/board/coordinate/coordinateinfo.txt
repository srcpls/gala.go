the struct coordinate contains a j value and an i value which correspond respectively with the conventional x and y values. they indicate where exactly a stone is located on the board, or within gala.go, the grid, which is a 19x19 integer matrix representation of the board with a 0 value for an empty space, a 1 for a black stone, and a 2 for a white stone. a coordinate can also contain a t value which has yet to be implemented but will store the turn the coordinate was played (which I suspect will be helpful later in gala.go's development).
